# job-search-visualisation

Finding my first developer role has been a gruelling process - and I'm still searching! I wanted to put together a small app to visualise my application process using [d3](https://d3js.org/) - eventually displaying my journey in a [Sankey Diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey)

## Running the app

- Server - run `rails s` - runs on local port 3000
- Client - run `npm start` - runs on local port 4000

## TDD

- I have opted for a complete TDD approach with this project
- Backend tests for models and requests uses [`Rspec`](https://rspec.info/)
- Fronend tests will use [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

# Example Sankey Diagram using SankeyMATIC

Chart that I will use for now - while I'm figuring out how to use D3
