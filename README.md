# job-search-visualisation

Finding my first developer role has been a gruelling process - and I'm still searching! I wanted to put together a small app to visualise my application process [d3](https://d3js.org/) - eventually displaying my journey in a [Sankey Diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey)

## Running the app

- Server - run `rails s`
- Client - run `npm start`
